# You will be building a command line Hangman game where one player plays against the computer, but a bit more advanced.

# When a new game is started, your script should load in the dictionary and randomly
# select a word between 5 and 12 characters long for the secret word.

# You donâ€™t need to draw an actual stick figure (though you can if you want to!),
# but do display some sort of count so the player knows how many more incorrect guesses they have before the game ends.

# You should also display which correct letters have already been chosen (and their position in the word,
# e.g. _ r o g r a _ _ i n g) and which incorrect letters have already been chosen.

# Every turn, allow the player to make a guess of a letter.
# It should be case insensitive. Update the display to reflect whether the letter was correct or incorrect.
# If out of guesses, the player should lose.

# Now implement the functionality where, at the start of any turn,
# instead of making a guess the player should also have the option to save the game.
# Remember what you learned about serializing objects.

# When the program first loads, add in an option that allows you to open one of your saved games,
# which should jump you exactly back to where you were when you saved. Play on!#
