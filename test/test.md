Assignment

Clone our ruby testing repo and complete the lessons in the spec folder.

Go back to the Caesar Cipher Project and write tests for your code. It shouldn’t take more than a half-dozen tests to cover all the possible cases. As always, use the git workflow you learned in Revisiting Rock Paper Scissors to work on a new feature so you can work on your new code without fear.
Write tests for your Tic Tac Toe project. In this situation, it’s not quite as straightforward as just coming up with inputs and making sure the method returns the correct thing. You’ll need to make sure the tests that determine victory or loss conditions are correctly assessed.
Start by writing tests to make sure players win when they should, e.g. when the board reads X X X across the top row, your #game_over method (or its equivalent) should trigger.
Test each of your critical methods to make sure they function properly and handle edge cases.
Use mocks/doubles to isolate methods to make sure that they’re sending back the right outputs.
